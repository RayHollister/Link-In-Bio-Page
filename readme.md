Easily create an Instagram "Link in Bio" page in Wordpress

**== Description ==**
Need a Link in Bio page for Instagram, but don't want to pay for a separate service that just posts links and images on a website? You already have a website! Why maintain two separate websites just because Instagram doesn't have links for some reason?!

This plugin makes it easy to host your own Link in Bio page on your website! And, you can style it how ever you want!

**== Installation ==**
Download the plugin and put it in your plugins folder. 
Then, activate the plugin.
From there, you add the custom post type to the page you want it to appear on.

**== Frequently Asked Questions ==**

**Does this work with Wordpress Theme Builders like Divi, Elementor, Oxygen, Themeco Pro, etc?**
It literally only works with builder themes. You have to be able to pull in a custom post type into the content for this to work. 

**Does this work with vanilla Wordpress?**
No, didn't you read the FAQ above? You have to be using a theme builder like Divi, Elementor, Oxygen, Themeco Pro, etc to use this plugin.

**Do you ever plan on making this work with vanilla Wordpress?**
Yeah, maybe one day. I might add a shortcode and make it super easy, but right now I am le tired.

**== Changelog ==**
0.2 Created the default channel Instagram to make it easier for websites that only have one Instgram account to deal with. Now you don't have to select the Channel everytime you add a new Link in Bio. \( ﾟヮﾟ)/
0.1 I literally just converted this from a function in another plugin to its own standalone plugin.
